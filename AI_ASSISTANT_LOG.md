## Session 2: September 26, 2025 - Fixing Null Byte Errors in Python Files
**Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot
**Task:** Fixing null byte errors in Python files that were preventing server startup

### Prompts Used:
1. "Fix null byte errors in Python files"
2. "How to detect and remove null bytes from Python modules"
3. "Fixing import errors in FastAPI application"

### Initial Issue:
Backend server was failing to start due to null byte characters in Python files, particularly in `__init__.py` files. These invisible characters were causing import errors that prevented proper module loading.

### Generated Code:
```python
# AI-Generated script to detect and fix null byte errors
import os

def fix_null_bytes(directory):
    """Remove null bytes from Python files in the specified directory."""
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
                try:
                    # Read the file content
                    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:
                        content = f.read()
                    
                    # Check for null bytes
                    if b'\x00' in content:
                        print(f"Found null bytes in {filepath}")
                        # Replace null bytes and write back
                        clean_content = content.replace(b'\x00', b'')
                        with open(filepath, 'wb') as f:
                            f.write(clean_content)
                        print(f"Fixed {filepath}")
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"Error processing {filepath}: {e}")

# Call with backend directory
fix_null_bytes("./backend/app")
```

### Modifications Made:
- Instead of using the detection script, I recreated the problematic files with clean content
- Fixed several files including:
  - `__init__.py` in multiple directories
  - `flight_service.py` which had similar issues
  - Other service and model files
- Ensured proper UTF-8 encoding for all Python files

### Outcome:
- Successfully eliminated null byte errors from all Python files
- Backend server now runs without import errors
- Fixed the module import chain allowing proper application startup
- Re-created problematic files with proper content

### Screenshots/Recording:
![alt text](image-3.png)
![alt text](image-4.png)

### Next Steps:
1. Test API endpoints to ensure they're functioning correctly
2. Verify database connectivity and models
3. Set up development workflow to prevent similar issues

## Session 3: September 27, 2025 - API Exploration and Endpoint Testing
**Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot
**Task:** Exploring and testing flight API endpoints

### Prompts Used:
1. "How to see if API endpoints are defined and that they are responding"
2. "List FastAPI flight API endpoints with curl and HTTPie examples" 
3. "Please scan all files in this repository and generate a structured summary of the project"

### Initial Issue:
After fixing the null byte errors, I needed to verify that the API endpoints were correctly defined and responding. There was confusion about the correct URL paths due to inconsistency between configuration and implementation.

### API Testing Commands:
```powershell
# AI-Generated test command for PowerShell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/flights/" -Method GET

# AI-Generated test command for creating a flight
$body = @{
    "flight_number" = "FL999"
    "departure_city" = "New York"
    "arrival_city" = "Tokyo"
    "departure_time" = "2025-10-15T08:00:00"
    "arrival_time" = "2025-10-15T22:00:00"
    "price" = 1200
    "available_seats" = 200
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/flights/" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

### Project Structure Analysis:
Copilot helped analyze the entire project structure and provided a comprehensive summary, including backend architecture, frontend components, and API endpoints.

### Modifications Made:
- Adjusted the API endpoint paths from `/api/v1/flights/` to `/api/flights/` based on findings
- Fixed inconsistency between config settings and actual router mounting
- Created test data to verify endpoint functionality

### Outcome:
- Identified and tested working API endpoints:
  - GET /api/flights/ (list all flights)
  - GET /api/flights/{flight_id} (get specific flight)
  - POST /api/flights/ (create new flight)
- Created a test flight using the API and confirmed it was added to the database
- Generated a comprehensive project structure document
- Identified key areas for improvement in both frontend and backend

### Screenshots/Recording:
![alt text](image-5.png)
![alt text](image-6.png)

### Next Steps:
1. Fix API version inconsistency by updating router prefix in `main.py`
2. Complete flight endpoints in backend (update/delete operations)
3. Create admin flight management UI in frontend
4. Connect frontend to backend API endpoints

## Session 4: September 28, 2025 - Database Migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
**Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot  
**Task:** Resolving database configuration conflicts and migrating to PostgreSQL

### Initial Crisis:
Getting "internal server error" when trying to access flight data. The application seemed to work but no flights were showing, and the backend was throwing mysterious database connection errors.

### Prompts Used:
1. "check if database values are already added since my api server backend is running but idk if it is sqlite or postgres"
2. "first check if database values are already added"
3. "where do i perform step1" (for database testing)
4. "help me perform step2" (for database initialization)

### The Discovery - Configuration Conflict:
The root cause was a configuration nightmare - my application was trying to use both SQLite and PostgreSQL simultaneously!

### Critical Generated Solutions:

#### 1. Database Connection Test Script:
```python
# AI-Generated diagnostic script that revealed the truth
import sys  
from pathlib import Path
from app.core.config import settings
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

def test_connection():
    print(f"Testing connection with: {settings.DATABASE_URL}")
    
    try:
        engine = create_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)
        with engine.connect() as connection:
            result = connection.execute(text("SELECT current_database(), current_user, version();"))
            row = result.fetchone()
            print(f"‚úì Successfully connected to database: {row[0]}")
            print(f"‚úì Connected as user: {row[1]}")  
            print(f"‚úì PostgreSQL version: {row[2]}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Connection failed: {e}")
```

#### 2. Database Status Check Script:
```python
# AI-Generated script that showed I had both databases with different data
def check_database_status():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        # Check what database we're actually using
        user_count = db.query(User).count()
        flight_count = db.query(Flight).count() 
        booking_count = db.query(Booking).count()
        
        print(f"‚úàÔ∏è  Flights: {flight_count}")
        print(f"üë• Users: {user_count}")
        print(f"üé´ Bookings: {booking_count}")
        
    finally:
        db.close()
```

### The Shocking Discovery:
When I ran the diagnostic scripts, I discovered:
- **PostgreSQL database**: Properly configured but EMPTY (0 flights)
- **SQLite file**: Still existed with old test data  
- **Config.py**: Was overriding my .env PostgreSQL settings and forcing SQLite!

### Configuration Fix:
```python
# The problematic code I had to remove from config.py:
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # THIS WAS THE CULPRIT - forcing SQLite regardless of .env!
        if not self.DATABASE_URL.startswith("sqlite"):
            self.DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./airline.db"  # REMOVED THIS!
```

### Database Setup Commands Generated:
```sql
-- AI-Generated PostgreSQL setup commands
CREATE USER airline_user WITH PASSWORD 'postgres123';
CREATE DATABASE airline_db OWNER airline_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE airline_db TO airline_user;
\c airline_db
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO airline_user;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT ALL ON TABLES TO airline_user;
```

### Table Creation Script:
```python
# AI-Generated database initialization
def create_tables():
    print(f"Using database: {settings.DATABASE_URL}")
    print("Creating database tables...")
    
    try:
        # Import all models to register them with Base
        from app.models import user, flight, booking
        
        # Create all tables
        Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
        print("‚úì Tables created successfully!")
        
    except Exception as e:
4. **Deleted old SQLite file** - Removed `airline.db` to prevent confusion
5. **Created database tables** - Properly initialized PostgreSQL schema

### Outcome:
- ‚úÖ **Successful Database Migration:** From SQLite to PostgreSQL with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ **Clean Configuration:** No more database conflicts
- ‚úÖ **Proper Database Setup:** PostgreSQL ready for production-scale data
- ‚úÖ **Verified Connection:** All diagnostic scripts showing PostgreSQL connectivity

### Personal Learning Moment:
This was the most frustrating yet educational experience. I learned that:
- **Environment variables can be overridden** by configuration logic
- **Always verify which database you're actually using** 
- **Configuration conflicts cause the most mysterious errors**
- **Diagnostic scripts are essential** for complex applications

```python
def populate_australian_flights():
    """Populate database with realistic Australian domestic flights"""
    
        ('Gold Coast', 'Sydney'), ('Hobart', 'Melbourne'),
        # ... total of 45 route combinations
    ]
    
    # Real Australian airlines with proper codes
    airlines = [
        ('QF', 'Qantas'), ('VA', 'Virgin Australia'), 
        ('JQ', 'Jetstar'), ('ZL', 'Rex Airlines'), ('TT', 'Tigerair')
    ]
    
    flights_created = 0
    current_date = datetime.now().date()
    end_date = datetime(2026, 1, 31).date()
    
    # Generate multiple flights per route per day
    while current_date <= end_date:
        for departure_city, arrival_city in australian_routes:
            for airline_code, airline_name in airlines:
                # Multiple flights per day (2-4 flights)
                flights_per_day = random.randint(2, 4)
                    
                    # Realistic flight duration (1-5 hours based on distance)
                    flight_duration = calculate_flight_duration(departure_city, arrival_city)
                    
                    # Realistic AUD pricing based on route distance and airline
                    base_price = calculate_base_price(departure_city, arrival_city, airline_code)
                    price = base_price + random.uniform(-50, 100)  # Price variation
                    
                    #

                    flight = Flight(
                        flight_number=f"{airline_code}{random.randint(100, 999)}",
                        departure_city=departure_city,
                        arrival_city=arrival_city,
                        departure_time=departure_datetime,
                        arrival_time=arrival_datetime, 
                        price=round(price, 2),
                        available_seats=random.randint(50, 200)
                    )
                    
                    flights_created += 1
        
- **Routes:** 45 realistic Australian domestic routes
- **Airlines:** Qantas (QF), Virgin Australia (VA), Jetstar (JQ), Rex Airlines (ZL), Tigerair (TT)

### Frontend Search Implementation:

#### AI-Generated Functional Search Form:
```tsx
// Replaced static UI with dynamic Australian flight search
const australianCities = [
  'Sydney', 'Melbourne', 'Brisbane', 'Perth', 'Adelaide', 
  'Gold Coast', 'Canberra', 'Darwin', 'Hobart', 'Cairns'

                    <span style="color:#1976d2; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.2em;">Session 7: September 29, 2025 - Edit and Delete Flight</span>
const [searchForm, setSearchForm] = useState({
  departureCity: '',
  arrivalCity: '', 
  departureDate: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  travelers: 1
});


  const searchParams = new URLSearchParams({
    departure_city: searchForm.departureCity,
    arrival_city: searchForm.arrivalCity,
    departure_date: searchForm.departureDate,
    skip: '0',
    limit: '50'
  });
  
  const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8000/api/flights/?${searchParams}`);
### UI Improvements Made:
1. **Removed Return Date Field** - Simplified to one-way search
