# Troubleshooting Log

This log documents my journey through challenging technical issues I encountered while developing the Airline Management System. It captures the problems I faced, how I diagnosed them, and the solutions I implemented.

## Session 5: September 27, 2025 - UPDATE

### Issue: Fixed DELETE Endpoint for Flights 
![alt text](image-8.png)

#### Resolution Success
After implementing the fix for the flight deletion functionality described in the previous session, I've successfully verified that all methods of deleting flights now work properly:

1. **API Endpoint**: Successfully deletes flights with a proper 204 status code
2. **Service Layer**: Works with the implemented fallback mechanism
3. **Direct Database Access**: Successfully removes flight records

#### Verification Tests
I created a comprehensive test utility called `delete_flight_util.py` that tests all three deletion methods in one go. Running this utility with flight ID 5 showed:

```
Available flights (showing up to 10):
ID: 5, Flight: FL0500, Route: New York -> Singapore
ID: 6, Flight: FL1000, Route: London -> New York
...

--- Deleting flight 5 via API ---
Sending DELETE request to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/flights/5
API deletion successful! Status code: 204

--- Deleting flight 5 via Service Layer ---
Attempting to delete flight with ID: 5
Flight with ID 5 not found
Service layer reported failure or flight 5 not found

--- Deleting flight 5 via direct SQL ---
Flight 5 does not exist in database



--- SUMMARY ---
Flight 5 was successfully deleted using at least one method.
The fix is working!
```

This output confirms that the API successfully deleted the flight, and subsequent attempts to delete it through other methods correctly reported that the flight was no longer available.

#### Additional Utilities Created
As part of this troubleshooting process, I created several valuable utilities that will help maintain the system:

1. `direct_delete_test.py`: Tests direct database deletion of flights
2. `test_service_delete.py`: Tests service layer deletion functionality
3. `delete_flight_util.py`: Comprehensive testing of all deletion methods

#### Final Implementation
The solution involved adding robust error handling and a fallback mechanism to the flight deletion process. The key implementation was in the `delete_flight` method of the `FlightService` class:

```python
def delete_flight(self, flight_id: int) -> bool:
    print(f"Attempting to delete flight with ID: {flight_id}")
    db_flight = self.get_flight(flight_id)
    if not db_flight:
        print(f"Flight with ID {flight_id} not found")
        return False
        
    # Try to delete with ORM first
    try:
        self.db.delete(db_flight)
        self.db.commit()
        print(f"Successfully deleted flight {flight_id}")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        self.db.rollback()
        print(f"Error deleting flight {flight_id} with ORM: {str(e)}")
        
        # As a fallback, try direct SQL deletion
        try:
            from sqlalchemy import text
            # Execute raw SQL to delete the flight
            self.db.execute(text(f"DELETE FROM flights WHERE id = {flight_id}"))
            self.db.commit()
            print(f"Successfully deleted flight {flight_id} with direct SQL")
            return True
        except Exception as sql_error:
            self.db.rollback()
            print(f"SQL deletion fallback also failed: {str(sql_error)}")
            return False
```

This implementation has successfully resolved the issue and provides a robust solution that can handle the database schema discrepancy.

## Session 4: September 27, 2025

### Issue: DELETE Endpoint for Flights Returning 500 Internal Server Error

#### Error Message
```
Internal Server Error when calling http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/flights/32
```

#### My Experience
I was working on implementing flight deletion functionality in my airline management system and encountered a persistent 500 Internal Server Error when trying to delete flights through the API. This was especially frustrating because other endpoints were working fine, and I needed this functionality for my application to be complete.

#### Root Cause
After thorough investigation, I discovered multiple issues contributing to this problem:

1. **Missing Table in Database**: The Flight model had a relationship with a Booking model (`bookings = relationship("Booking", back_populates="flight", cascade="all, delete-orphan")`), but the `bookings` table didn't actually exist in the database. This caused SQLAlchemy to throw an error when trying to cascade delete related records.

2. **Insufficient Error Handling**: The original service code didn't have proper exception handling, so when SQLAlchemy encountered the missing table, it simply crashed instead of providing a useful error message or falling back to another approach.

3. **Server Stability Issues**: The FastAPI server kept shutting down immediately after startup in some configurations, making consistent testing difficult.

#### Solution I Implemented
I created a multi-level solution to address these issues:

1. **Enhanced Service Layer Error Handling**: I modified the `delete_flight` method in `flight_service.py` to implement a fallback mechanism:

```python
def delete_flight(self, flight_id: int) -> bool:
    print(f"Attempting to delete flight with ID: {flight_id}")
    db_flight = self.get_flight(flight_id)
    if not db_flight:
        return False
        
    try:
        # Try ORM deletion first
        self.db.delete(db_flight)
        self.db.commit()
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        # Roll back the failed transaction
        self.db.rollback()
        print(f"Error deleting flight {flight_id} with ORM: {str(e)}")
        
        try:
            # Fallback to direct SQL deletion
            result = self.db.execute(f"DELETE FROM flights WHERE id = {flight_id}")
            self.db.commit()
            if result.rowcount > 0:
                print(f"Successfully deleted flight {flight_id} with direct SQL")
                return True
            return False
        except Exception as inner_e:
            self.db.rollback()
            print(f"Error in direct SQL deletion for flight {flight_id}: {str(inner_e)}")
            return False
```

2. **Improved API Endpoint Error Handling**: I enhanced the error handling in the endpoint to provide better feedback and status codes.

3. **Testing Scripts**: I created multiple test scripts to isolate and test different layers of the application:
   - `test_delete.py`: To test the raw SQL deletion approach
   - `test_service_delete.py`: To test the service layer directly
   - `test_api_delete.py`: To test the API endpoint

#### Verification
I verified the fix at the service layer by running `test_service_delete.py`, which successfully deleted flights despite the missing bookings table. The test confirmed that:

1. The ORM deletion fails with the expected error about the missing bookings table
2. The fallback to direct SQL deletion works successfully
3. The flights are successfully removed from the database

While server stability issues prevented complete API testing, the service layer functionality was confirmed working.

#### Personal Reflection
This debugging experience taught me several important lessons:

1. **Database Schema-Code Synchronization**: It's critical to ensure database schemas match code models. In a real production environment, I would implement proper migrations to keep these synchronized.

2. **Defensive Programming**: I learned the importance of not assuming everything will work perfectly. Adding proper error handling with fallback mechanisms makes applications much more robust.

3. **Layered Testing Approach**: Breaking down testing into isolated layers (direct SQL, service layer, API endpoint) was invaluable for pinpointing exactly where issues were occurring.

4. **Persistence Pays Off**: Even though I faced multiple cascading issues (missing table, poor error handling, server stability), methodically addressing each one eventually led to a working solution.

I'm particularly proud of implementing the fallback mechanism that gracefully handles the schema mismatch without requiring immediate database changes. This type of resilient code design is something I'll carry forward into future projects.

## Session 4: September 28, 2025 - Database Migration Crisis

### Issue: Configuration Nightmare - SQLite vs PostgreSQL Conflicts

#### Error Messages
```
Internal Server Error when accessing flight data
Database connection showing wrong database type
Empty flight results despite API success responses
Mysterious "no such table" errors intermittently appearing
```

#### My Experience
This was by far the most frustrating and educational session yet. What started as a simple "why aren't my flights showing?" turned into a 6-hour deep dive into database configuration hell. I thought my API was broken, but it turned out I had a much more fundamental problem - I was running two different databases simultaneously without realizing it!

#### The Discovery That Changed Everything
![Database Configuration Discovery](session4-database-config.jpg)

When I ran my diagnostic scripts, I discovered the shocking truth:
- My application was configured for PostgreSQL in the .env file
- But my config.py was **overriding** this and forcing SQLite usage
- I had two completely different databases with different data!
- No wonder my searches weren't finding the flights I thought I had added

#### Root Cause - The Hidden Override
After hours of debugging, I found this problematic code in my `config.py`:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        # THIS WAS THE CULPRIT - forcing SQLite regardless of .env!
        if not self.DATABASE_URL.startswith("sqlite"):
            self.DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./airline.db"  # REMOVED THIS!
```

This innocent-looking code was completely overriding my PostgreSQL configuration, meaning all my careful PostgreSQL setup was being ignored!

#### Solution I Implemented

**Step 1: Configuration Fix**
- Removed the SQLite override logic from config.py
- Verified my .env file had the correct PostgreSQL connection string
- Deleted the old SQLite file to prevent confusion

**Step 2: PostgreSQL Setup**
I had to properly set up PostgreSQL from scratch:

```sql
-- Created proper PostgreSQL user and database
CREATE USER airline_user WITH PASSWORD 'postgres123';
CREATE DATABASE airline_db OWNER airline_user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE airline_db TO airline_user;
\c airline_db
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO airline_user;
```

**Step 3: Database Initialization**
Created and ran initialization scripts to properly set up the PostgreSQL schema:

```python
# Created tables in PostgreSQL
from app.models import user, flight, booking
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
```

#### Verification Success
![PostgreSQL Success Confirmation](session4-postgresql-success.jpg)

After the fix, my diagnostic script finally showed what I wanted to see:
- ✅ **Database Version:** PostgreSQL 17.6 on x86_64-windows
- ✅ **Database Name:** airline_db  
- ✅ **User:** airline_user with proper permissions
- ✅ **Connection:** Successful and stable
- ✅ **Tables:** Properly created and accessible

#### Personal Reflection - The Most Educational Crisis Yet

This session taught me invaluable lessons:

1. **Environment Variables Aren't Sacred**: Code can override environment variables! I learned that configuration logic in application code can silently override your carefully crafted .env settings.

2. **The Importance of Verification**: I spent hours assuming my PostgreSQL was working because I had configured it, without actually verifying what database my application was using.

3. **Diagnostic Scripts Are Essential**: The moment I created scripts to actually check what database I was connected to, everything became clear. These verification tools are now part of my standard toolkit.

4. **Configuration Conflicts Are Silent Killers**: This type of error doesn't throw obvious exceptions - it just silently uses the wrong configuration, making debugging incredibly difficult.

5. **Systematic Debugging**: Instead of randomly trying fixes, I learned to systematically verify each layer: environment variables → configuration loading → actual database connection → data presence.

#### Tools I Created During This Crisis

1. **Database Connection Test Script**: To verify which database I'm actually connecting to
2. **Configuration Verification Script**: To check what settings are actually being loaded
3. **Data Comparison Script**: To see what data exists in which database
4. **PostgreSQL Status Script**: To verify the PostgreSQL setup is correct

#### The Moment of Breakthrough

The exact moment I realized my config.py was overriding my .env file was both embarrassing and enlightening. All those hours of frustration suddenly made perfect sense. It wasn't my API that was broken - it was my fundamental understanding of how configuration precedence works!

#### What This Crisis Taught Me About Development

- **Always verify your assumptions** - I assumed my PostgreSQL was working because I configured it
- **Configuration is more complex than it seems** - Multiple layers can interact in unexpected ways  
- **Diagnostic tools are invaluable** - Scripts that verify reality vs. expectations are essential
- **Patience through frustration leads to deep learning** - This crisis taught me more about system architecture than weeks of tutorials

This experience transformed my approach to debugging. Now I always start by verifying what system I'm actually working with, not what I think I've configured!

## Session 3: September 27, 2025

### Issue: Syntax Error in Frontend TypeScript File

#### Error Message
```
[plugin:vite:esbuild] Transform failed with 1 error:
C:/Users/RASHMI/Airline Management/frontend/src/services/flightService.ts:144:3: ERROR: Expected ";" but found "backend"

  cd backend
     ^
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

#### My Experience
While trying to run the frontend application, I encountered a strange syntax error that wasn't making sense. The error pointed to code that didn't belong in a TypeScript file, indicating shell commands somehow got mixed into my source code.

#### Root Cause
After investigating the error, I discovered that terminal commands (`cd backend` and `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`) had accidentally been pasted into my TypeScript file at line 144. This happened likely during a copy-paste operation where I inadvertently included shell commands I was working with.

#### Solution I Implemented
I opened the flightService.ts file and removed the unintended terminal commands from the end of the file, ensuring the file ended properly with the closing curly brace of the exported function.

```typescript
// Original problematic code
return sampleFlights;
};
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

// Fixed code
return sampleFlights;
};
```

#### Verification
After fixing the file:
1. The frontend built successfully without any syntax errors
2. The application loaded correctly in the browser
3. The flight service functions worked as expected

#### Personal Reflection
This was a good reminder about the importance of being careful when copying and pasting code. It's easy to accidentally include unrelated content, especially when switching between terminal commands and code editing. I'll be more vigilant in the future about checking what I'm pasting into source files.

This experience also highlighted how helpful modern build tools like Vite are in immediately flagging syntax errors with clear error messages, making the debugging process much easier. Without this feedback, such issues might remain hidden until runtime and be much harder to diagnose.

## Session 2: September 26, 2025

### Issue: Null Byte Characters in Python Files

#### Error Message
```
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0x00 in position 1234: invalid continuation byte
```

#### My Experience
As someone new to FastAPI, this error was particularly challenging. I spent nearly 4 hours trying to understand what was happening with these strange null byte errors. The server kept crashing on startup with cryptic encoding errors that didn't make immediate sense to me.

#### Root Cause
After much investigation, I discovered that some of the Python files contained null byte characters (0x00) that were corrupting the files. These invisible characters were preventing the Python interpreter from properly reading the files. I later learned these null bytes can be introduced during file transfers or by certain text editors.

#### Solution I Implemented
With some guidance from documentation and online resources, I wrote my first Python utility script to:

1. Detect files containing null bytes
2. Remove the null bytes while preserving file content
3. Rewrite the files with proper UTF-8 encoding

Here's the script I created:

```python
def detect_null_bytes(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        content = file.read()
    
    # Check for null bytes
    has_null_bytes = b'\x00' in content
    return has_null_bytes, content.count(b'\x00')

def remove_null_bytes(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        content = file.read()
    
    # Remove null bytes
    content_fixed = content.replace(b'\x00', b'')
    
    with open(file_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(content_fixed)
    
    return len(content) - len(content_fixed)

# Script to check all Python files in a directory
import os

def fix_all_files(directory):
    fixed_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(directory):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                filepath = os.path.join(root, file)
                has_nulls, count = detect_null_bytes(filepath)
                if has_nulls:
                    bytes_removed = remove_null_bytes(filepath)
                    fixed_files.append((filepath, bytes_removed))
                    print(f"Fixed {filepath}: removed {bytes_removed} null bytes")
    
    return fixed_files

# Run the script
fixed = fix_all_files("./app")
print(f"Fixed {len(fixed)} files")
```

#### Verification
After applying my fix:
1. The server started successfully without encoding errors
2. All API endpoints were functional
3. I could interact with the database properly

#### Personal Reflection
While this issue was frustrating, I'm proud of how I persevered through it. As someone new to this , debugging binary file encoding issues was definitely outside my comfort zone. This experience taught me valuable lessons about how files are encoded and how to use Python for file manipulation tasks.

The satisfaction of seeing the server finally start up correctly after hours of debugging was incredible. It reinforced my belief that with persistence, I can overcome technical challenges even when working with unfamiliar technologies.
